 *
 * This project is about an assignment related to a simple application, 
 * designed using C language, that performs statistical analytics on a dataset.
 * In other words, it includes a couple of functions that can analyze an array of 
 * unsigned char data items and report analytics on the maximum, minimum, mean,
 * and median of the data set. In addition, the data set is reordered from
 * large to small values. All statistics are rounded down to the nearest 
 * integer. After analysis and sorting, the data set is printed to the screen
 * in a nicely formatted presentation.
 *
 * It includes the following three files:
 *
 * README.md: includes information on the author and the project (this file!)
 * stats.h: header file for the application
 * stats.c: implementation file for the application
